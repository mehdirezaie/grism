    "# Flat Fielding of Slitless Spectroscopy\n",
    "\n",
    "## 0.  Primer\n",
    "Slitless spectroscopy uses a dispersive and transmissive optical element in the collimated beam to create a complete spectroscopic view of any astrophysical scene.  However, the lack of any light-restricting aperture (such as a slitlet, fiber, etc.), means that the spectral trace of multiple sources may overlap in the two-dimensional grism image.  Therefore a given imaging pixel may record the flux (at different wavelengths) from the multiple sources and/or background components (such as Zodiacal background, thermal emission, etc.).  Here, we discuss the issues associated with extending the classical application of a flat-field image to correct for pixel-to-pixel variations in the imaging device to that of slitless spectroscopy.\n",

    "\n",
    "One key difference between a grism optical element and a standard imaging element is that light incident on a given pixel $(x_d,y_d)$ will be recorded a new pixel position $(x_g,y_g)$, where that remapping is done as a function of wavelength and $(x_d,y_d)$.  This process must be calibrated by standard observations, which often results in determining the spectral trace and dispersion solution.  Software has been developed by [Nor Prizkal and Russell Ryan](https://www.stsci.edu/files/live/sites/www/files/home/hst/instrumentation/wfc3/documentation/instrument-science-reports-isrs/_documents/2017/WFC3-2017-01.pdf) to implement these transformations, and are represented a parametric functions:\n",

    "\\lambda = \\Lambda (x_d,y_d,t)\n",

    "where $t$ is a parameter such that $0\\leq t\\leq1$.  With that, it is apparent that the response of a pixel must be reconsidered as the incident spectrum effectively eminates from a different position:\n",

    "***Note, here we take care to explicitly subscript $(x,y)$ with either $g$ or $d$ to refer to the measured position in a grism image or effective position from a direct image, respectively.***  Therefore, when flat-fielding one must invert the family of functions for $(x_g,y_g,\\lambda)$ to account for the relevant spectral components (whether from astrophysical sources or background contributions).  \n",
